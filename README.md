## Design Choices

The persona that 8 Meg Stick Records wish to primarily target are likely to be viewing the site on a phone. Therefore the site will be a mobile first approach.

The number one feature is links from each release to 6 of the most popular streaming platforms. There are:

- Spotify
- Apple Music

- Amazon Music
- Deezer
- Tidal

The look and feel of the site needs to be built around the 8 Meg Stick Records branding. The website needs to feel modern, vivid with vibrant and dynamic touches. The tone should
be professional but not corporate.

Below is the brand colour pallet for 8 Meg Stick Records. Whilst these form the foundation of the colour scheme other strong colours will be required to support vibrant 
accents on the website. Bold use of band photograpy and imagery is encouraged.

| Description | Hex Colour Value | Visual |
| --- | ----------- | --- |
| Dark grey which can be used extensively | #1a1a1a | <div markdown="1" style="background-color:#1a1a1a;color:#1a1a1a;">------</div> |
| Off white which can be used extensively | #f9f9f9 | <div style="background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#f9f9f9;" markdown="1">------</div> |
| Light yellow to be used as a primary colour | #ffdd55 | <div style="background-color:#ffdd55;color:#ffdd55;" markdown="1">------</div> |
| Darker yellow to be used as a secondary supportive colour | #d4aa00 | <div style="background-color:#d4aa00;color:#d4aa00;" markdown="1">------</div> |
| Sky blue to be used as a main highlight colour | #80ffe6 | <div style="background-color:#80ffe6;color:#80ffe6;" markdown="1">------</div> |


The main font used in the 8 Meg Stick Records logo is not available as a web font. This is a serif font. No other serif fonts should be used as may detract from the logo. 

The secondary font used in the logo is Noto Sans TC. This is available as a web font and will be used for headings.

Noto Sans will be used as the main content font as this is a complimentary font to Noto Sans TC.  

## Structure

Whilst the focus is on a mobile first design the website needs to provide an optimal experience across all screen types.

To ensure the experience is focussed on the releases this will be a multi-page website consisting of 4 pages.

1. releases
2. artists
3. about the label
4. contact

There will be a horizontal navigation bar at the top of each page facilitating access to other pages on the site. This navigation element will collaps on a mobile device.

The index.html page will contain the releases contect as this is the main focus of the site. All other pages will follow a consistent look and feel to the main page including 
the same footer element which contain the record labels social media links.

### The Releases Page

The top of the page needs to consist of strong imagery of the latest release or next up and coming release from the record label. This section needs to enable the 
viewer to sign up for new music release alerts from the label. This section needs to take up most but not all of the viewing area as to reveal the releases
beneath the hero image. The releases will be in in chronological order of their release. 
Each release section should display:

- Song title
- Artist name which links to the artist profile that will be situated on the artists page
- Cover art
- Links to streaming services

### The Atists Page

Beneath the navigation bar which is common to all of the pages the artists page will contain a section on each artist. This will progress down the page in alphabetical order. 
Each artist section will contain:

- Artist name
- Biography of the artist
- Links to their tracks on the releases page
- Photos and imagery (if available)
- Videos (if available)
- Social media links (if available)
- Any other links that support the artists profile

### The About Page

Beneath the navigation bar which is common to all of the pages the artists page will contain a section on the record label. This section will contain:

- An overview of the record label
- Outline the record label ethos and musical direction
- link to a form to submit a demo
- Link to a form to register for notifications of new releases
- Link to a general contact form

### The Contact Page

Beneath the navigation bar which is common to all of the pages the artists page will contain 3 forms.

1. A form to register or notifications of new releases
2. A form to submit a demo
3. A general contact form

## Wireframing

<img src="images/devices.png" style="margin: 0;">

Mocking up of the site was done using Figma. I chose to use full images and colour as opposed to sketch/line drawings as the site would have many images and elements and therefore be visually busy so I needed to understand the relationships of these images such as the release cover art.

A Figma wireframe for each page can be found in the links Below.
